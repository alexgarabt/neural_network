# Neural Network
Custom implementation of the vanilla neural networks, gradient descent & backpropagation.
This repo is a learning proyect.

## Implementation
~~1- Parameters (weights, bias, activations(cache)) storage~~
~~2- Neuron initialization~~
~~3- Forward propagation, activation function~~
~~4- Backward progagation~~
5- Training network
~~6- Test network
    * cost
    * recall
    * precission
    * accuracy
    * F~~
6- Inference
